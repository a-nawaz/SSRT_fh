# Skill Set Reset Tool

## Ubisoft - For Honor

Developed an internal tool for Ubisoft’s AAA title – For Honor. The tool can set/reset skills of any number of players by using their GT’s which needs to be inputted in an Excel file. The tool works for players in all 3 platforms (PC, PS4, X1). Developed a UI for the tool and also implemented a feature that resets the skill rating of all the players in a particular sandbox.
